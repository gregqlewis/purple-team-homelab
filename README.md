# Purple Team Home Lab

A comprehensive offensive and defensive security testing environment built on Unraid infrastructure. This lab enables realistic attack simulations with full detection and logging capabilities.

## Overview

This project documents the setup, configuration, and operation of a home cybersecurity lab designed for purple team operations - combining both offensive (red team) and defensive (blue team) security practices.

**Current Status:** 🚧 Documentation in progress

## Architecture

**Attack Infrastructure:**
- Kali Linux (Raspberry Pi 4) - Offensive security platform
- Metasploitable 2 (VM) - Intentionally vulnerable target system

**Detection & Logging Stack:**
- Wazuh - SIEM and threat detection
- Graylog - Log management and analysis
- OpenSearch - Log storage and indexing
- MongoDB - Metadata storage

**Infrastructure:**
- Unraid server hosting VMs and containers
- Isolated lab network segment
- Tailscale VPN for secure remote access

## Objectives

1. **Offensive Skills:** Practice penetration testing techniques in controlled environment
2. **Defensive Skills:** Develop and tune detection rules based on real attack patterns
3. **SIEM Engineering:** Build practical experience with enterprise logging infrastructure
4. **Incident Response:** Practice investigation workflows from alert to remediation
